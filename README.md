# electric-cpu
Home-designed CPU, and a documented process to build it

My Personal Plans - To be translated into Issue form:

1. Get Jekyll running on Windows using one of: jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation
   davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey
2. Figure out publishing/hosting GitHub pages using Jekyll
3. See if the Issues will be private and come up with a solution accordingly, use Project with Cards or not
4. Content: Create Introduction
5. Content: Scan in schematic, pictures, doc pages
6. Content:
   A) Existing 1100mA power supply
   B) Existing clock generator
   C) Existing frequency counter that can verify clock generator
7. Research: Determine if there is value in planning around A) Interrupt-handling
8. Research: Determine if there is value in planning around B) Multi-core (i.e. difference between a Core and a CPU?)
9. Write official Issues for the next work to proceed:
   A) Read and plan for building testable sub-projects/sub-circuits
   B) Plan a first sub-circuit
   C) Create first sub-circuit
   D) Test first sub-circuit
   E) Document the hardware, the planned build, issues and unknowns of the sub-circuit as it relates to CPU

-. Research: Methods and tooling to specify and 'hand-design' large control-logic circuit
