# electric-cpu
Home-designed CPU, and a documented process to build it

My Personal Plans - To be translated into Issue form:

1. Get Jekyll running on Windows using one of:

  - jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation
  - davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey

2. See if GitHub Issues will be private and come up with a solution accordingly, use Project with Cards or not

3. Content: Create Introduction

4. Content: Scan in schematic, pictures, doc pages

5. Content:

  - Existing 1100mA power supply
  - Existing clock generator
  - Existing frequency counter that can verify clock generator

6. Research: Determine if there is value in planning around A) Interrupt-handling

7. Research: Determine if there is value in planning around B) Multi-core (i.e. difference between a Core and a CPU)

8. Write official Issues for work to proceed:

  - Read and plan for building testable sub-projects/sub-circuits
  - Plan a first sub-circuit
  - Create first sub-circuit
  - Test first sub-circuit
  - Document the hardware, the planned build, issues and unknowns of the sub-circuit as it relates to CPU

9. Research: Simulation or software tooling to specify and 'hand-design' large control-logic circuit
